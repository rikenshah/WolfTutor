\subsection{Future enhancement}
During our initial brainstorming and pre-survey mentioned in section \ref{sec:enhancements}, several possible enhancements were discussed. The addition of optional filters to facilitate more specific matching when searching for a tutor, integtration with commonly used online calendar applications to facilitate booking a slot and to increase ease of use, the ability to cancel or reschedule a reservaton, allowing a student to view their reservation history and to use their history to make better recommendations for their next tutor, and integrating an online video interface to conduct tutoring sessions. Considering the short time frame for the project, we chose to implement the feature that was rated as the most important by our intended audience: viewing reservation history and giving recommendations for tutors with the goal of recommending a tutor the student would rate highly. The other features will be considered as future enhancements.
