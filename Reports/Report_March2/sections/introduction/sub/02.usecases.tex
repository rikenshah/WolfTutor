WolfTutor can be broken down into two types of users: tutors and students.
After enrolling in the system, the user's name, email, and phone number will be taken from slack and stored if available.

Students can:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find a tutor by from a complete list of all available tutors after selecting a subject from an existing list
  \item See the reviews for at tutor
  \item Book a tutor by choosing one of WolfTutor's defined 30 minute slots created from the availability given by the tutor
  \item Review a tutor from their last session (students have until the end of the day to review their tutor)
  \item View reservations and reward point balance (points are used to schedule sessions; 100 points are given at signup)
\end{enumerate}

Tutors can:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Become a tutor. WolfTutor only allows one major and one degree per tutor, but a tutor can represent multiple subjects. Tutor self-determines points pay rate and availability. Both apply to all subjects.
  \item View subjects and availability given to WolfTutor
  \item View reward point balance that can be used commercially
\end{enumerate}
