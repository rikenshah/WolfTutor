WolfTutor is a system that seeks to enable students to tutor other
students in a course-setting.  Wolf Tutor is a slack-based chat app
that attempts to connect potential tutors in given subjects with
students who need help with a course.  The idea here is peer tutoring,
not expert tutoring.  At first blush, it seems like the app is an app
to actually facilitate peer tutoring, which is not entirely accurate.
WolfTutor has functions to register tutors and students and to
schedule tutoring sessions.  It does not have functionality to
actually perform the tutoring itself, but is a logistic tool to enable
the coordination required to schedule tutoring sessions.  WolfTutor is
also gamified.  It rewards tutors who are highly rated with a points
system which can be implemented in a number of different contexts to
help incentivize students to tutor other students.
