  Peer tutoring is generally accepted as a great way to help students
  engage with material.  WolfTutor is one system, integrated with the
  popular chat program Slack, that seeks to facilitate peer-to-peer
  tutoring interactions by providing a mechanism for registering
  tutors, scheduling tutoring sessions, and incentivizing students to
  become tutors.  This paper proposes an enhancement to WolfTutor's
  tutoring matching process to help enable students to better choose
  what tutors they want to match with.
