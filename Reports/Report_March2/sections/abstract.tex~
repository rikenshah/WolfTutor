  Choosing a textbook for a class is something that many professors do
  several times a year, but the vast number of available textbooks for
  any given subject makes choosing one that both meets the needs of
  the class and meets the budget constraints of today's students is a challenge.  
  In this paper, we propose two methods for automatically learning
  topics from books, a set of evaluations for those methods, and a
  system that will use those methods in a web app that attempts to
  suggest textbooks to a professor balancing covering all topics the
  course requires while still being economical for students.
