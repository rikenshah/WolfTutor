MongoDB has serveral advantages. It is well documented for use with NodeJS, it is easy to set up a local database, it is also easy to set up online with MLAB platform and integrate into Heroku, and it is also easy to access through authorization credentials. Creating and uploading a mock database with a python script only took seconds with MLAB's authorization abilities to allow us to access the database outside of the MLAB site portal.
