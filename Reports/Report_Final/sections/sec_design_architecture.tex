Figure \ref{arch-pic} outlines the architecture of the application.
There are three main divisions: The user interface, the application server, and the database. 
Slack was used as the user interface. A custom bot was installed to that Slack page to handle 
interactive elements with the users. The applicaton was built with NodeJS. MongoDB was the 
database chosen to hold user data. For development purposes, a local server of NodeJS was run 
along with a local mongoDB database. Ngrok was used to tunnel webhooks between our local servers, 
which was necessary to get past local NATs and firewalls securely. The specific infrastructures are discussed as followed.
