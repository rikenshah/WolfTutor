After integrating the enhancements to the application, the following
changes were made to existing use cases as defined in sections
\ref{sec:student-use-cases} and \ref{sec:tutor-use-cases}.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Viewing past reservation history instead of only actively scheduled
reservations
  \item Tutors are required to list their GPA for their given degree. Users
are able to view that GPA when searching for a tutor
  \item Viewing the average review score of tutors when searching for a tutor
  \item  Allowing the user to opt to prioritize GPA or review scores for the 
matched tutors such that the user will see tutors filling those criteria first
  \item Tutors are displayed in reverse order such that a user will see the most 
recommended first in the Slack Application. Originally, a user would have to 
scroll all the way up to where the command was given to find a tutor to find 
the first posted tutor
\end{enumerate}
